# Recommend It

Now live on the [App Store]((https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/recommend-it/id951556200?ls=1&mt=8))! Check it out. (And don’t forget to [submit bugs](https://github.com/derrickshowers/recommend-it/issues))

A simple iOS app that helps you keep track of recommendations. The idea came from Yelp’s bookmark feature -- but the problem is, there is no way to add notes to your bookmarks on a mobile device.

So, let’s say you’re talking restaurants to a co-worker. He/she tells you about this awesome seafood restaurant by the bay. Woah! Wait a minute! Gotta write this down!! Thing is, (a) we’re no longer in the 90s (who writes stuff down?!) and (b) you know you’re going to lose that piece of paper. That’s where Recommend It comes in — search for the restaurant, add some notes (you want to make sure you remember who told you about it so you can go back and scream/yell at them if it sucks!), and BOOM, it’s on your list.
